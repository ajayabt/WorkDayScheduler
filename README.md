# Beginners-Coding-Quiz-Challenge


## Description

This is a basic work planner for daily scheduling. It will display different colours depending on whether the timeblock is in the past, present or future. Clicking the save button will save the content of the timeblock text area to local storage. Saved text will persist on page refresh.

I aimed to build/append the timeblocks using jQuery logic as it is what we have been learning this past week. It may have been more straightforward to use HTML elements for the timeblocks.

## Usage

 
This is a webpage. Timeblocks can be clicked to enter text which will save upon clicking the save icon. Saved content will persist after page refresh. 




## Credits
Starter code included the basic HTML file as well as the CSS stylings. As mentioned, the HTML and CSS is a part of the starter file. I have added one style class at the bottom of the CSS which is highlighted. Thank you to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far!
